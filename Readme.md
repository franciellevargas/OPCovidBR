# OPCovid-BR
The OPCovid-Br consists of a dataset of twitter data for fine-grained opinion mining or sentiment analysis applications in Portuguese Language. We extracted 600 twitters during the pandemic and annotated the opinion aspects for each twitter, as well as the binary document polarity (positive or negative).


We also provide machine learning-based classifiers for fine-grained opinion and polarity classification tasks using OPcovid-BR dataset. For polarity classification, we tested a cross-domain strategy in order to measure the performance of the classifiers among different domains. For fine-grained opinion identification, we created a taxonomy of aspects and employed them in conjunction with machine learning methods. Based on the obtained results, we found that the cross-domain method improved the results for polarity classification task. However, the use of a domain taxonomy presented competitive results for fine-grained opinion identification in Portuguese Language.
